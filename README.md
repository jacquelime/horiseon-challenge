Requirements
Up to date browser and um... a computer :) 

Project/Update Notes
I added alternate verbiage to improve accessibility on images. I consolidated CSS in instances where there was duplicate, unecessary code written. Added organization notes to HTML code as well as CSS code. Consolidated over 20 CSS rules that were superfulous. 

Design Notes
The Search Engine Optimization button was not properly bringing the user to the corresponding SEO Div, so I corrected this.

gitignore 
I created a gitignore file so as to not commit the .DS_Store from my computer
